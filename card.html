			<p>Rhinoceroses, often simply called “rhinos,” are amongst the largest of all land animals on the Earth. Because of this,
				 they are often classified as “megafauna,” which refers to animals over 2,200 lb (1,000 kg). The name “rhinoceros” comes
				 from the Greek “rhino” (nose) and “ceros” (horn), because all 5 species of rhino have either 1 or 2 horns on their nose.
